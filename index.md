## Welcome to my PowerShell Github Page!

I've been around working in IT for over 20 years and through my time in the tech space have been a community contributor, quick learner, collaborator, and sharer of information.  That's what I hope this site becomes!

Here, I hope to share a little of the following:

- PowerShell ```Code``` Samples
- Custom SAML using Azure AD
- Azure AD Application Registration Manifest knowledge
- Things I've learned about Markdown while learning how to create Github Pages!

And that's the work stuff - for personal, I'm an avid aspiring astrophotographer, and hope to share some insights there as well.  I'm a member of the [Charlie Elliott Astronomy Chapter](http://ceastronomy.org) of the [Atlanta Astronomy Club](http://atlantaastronomy.org/) in Georgia.  Maybe, I'll share some of my photos here when I get good enough!

Anyway, __stay tuned__, and I'll share more as time allows!
